# Computational-Geometry-and-Topology
Python library developed to apply computational geometry algorithms to datasets. This project was part of the "Computational Geometry" course at UPM, with the help of Manuel Abellanas (Applied Mathematics professor). The library contains Python functions that are increaingly complex and allow us to calculate the Voronoi diagram (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) and the Delaunay triangulation of a set of points (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). The library can be imported as a Python file or can be used in Sage Maths for a more visual representation (this is how we worked on this).

### Future steps

Some functions are suboptimal and for a bigger volume of data points would neeed to be optimized by researching more efficient code
